## Particles collision animation

This application simulates moving particles of different masses and radiuses in a square area. Particles can bounce off walls and each other following physics laws. It assumes that motion of the particles is linear and uniform and no external forces act on these particles.

#### To run the project:

- Make sure You have java installed
- `javac -cp './lib/algs4.jar' src/*.java -d bin`
- `java -cp './bin;./lib/algs4.jar' App < ./examples/diffusion.txt`
